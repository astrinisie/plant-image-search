# plant-image-search
Generating images of plants based on csv lists containing species names of the plant.

The idea is to help guide online plant buying without the luxury of first seeing the plant in person during the pandemic. 
List of plants are taken from http://citypeoples.com/gardenstore/.

The code is generated utilizing google_images_download package from https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download, 
with some editing done to alter names of saved images (changes shown in my personal fork)
